# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple Tic Tac Toe game that I made as a side project.
Code uses the following:
- Arrays
- Constants
- Boolean Variables
- Constant Booleans 
- If statements
- Nested For loops
- While loops
- Switch case statements

NOTE: I made this after completing my intro to coding class. I believe that more changes can be made and can be rewritten using structures and classes once I learn them.
